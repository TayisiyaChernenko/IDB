First, the AI must be run by going into the AI directory, installing the 
requirements.txt file with the command pip install -r requirements.txt.
Then, the AI can be run with python3 AI1.py

Next, run the Node server found in the mern/server directory with node server.js

Finally, npm start the React app in the mern/client directory. 

The react app should open in localhost.
